# Encoding-Comparison-Analysis

Label encoder v/s One hot encoder

Typically, any structured dataset includes multiple columns – a combination of numerical as well as categorical variables. A machine can only understand the numbers and not the text. That’s essentially the case with Machine Learning algorithms too.

That’s primarily the reason we need to convert categorical columns to numerical columns so that a machine learning algorithm understands it. This process is called categorical encoding. Categorical encoding is a process of converting categories to numbers.

There are multiple ways of handling Categorical variables. In this notebook, we will see widely used techniques:

Label Encoding

One-Hot Encoding

We will infer the winner by comparing MSE of both the models!!!
